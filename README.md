## AI Provider & Keys

- Default provider: DeepSeek Reasoner (`deepseek-reasoner`).
- Configure your key via the in-app Settings modal (Main nav â†’ AI Settings). Keys are stored locally in `localStorage` for development.
- Config utilities are in `src/config/apiConfig.ts`.

## Countdown During Generation

- When generating with an API provider, the UI shows a 20-second countdown on buttons in `src/components/CourseGenerator.tsx` and `src/components/TopicGenerator.tsx` to set expectations for response time.

## Features

- Topic and language learning flows
- Flashcards and quizzes with basic spaced-review hooks
- Course generator (DeepSeek-powered)
- Gamification (XP, streaks)
- Accessible UI improvements (semantic buttons, aria-live status)
- Basic analytics facade with safe no-ops
- Offline support: `public/sw.js`, `public/site.webmanifest`

## Accessibility

- Click handlers moved from containers to real buttons in `src/components/MainNavigation.tsx`.
- `aria-live` region in `src/components/TopicCheckButton.tsx` to announce status.
- Continued audit recommended for labels, roles, and focus styles.

## SEO & PWA

- SEO tags in `index.html` with canonical and structured data (update domain before prod)
- `public/sitemap.xml` and `public/robots.txt` (staging locked down)
- PWA manifest `public/site.webmanifest` and service worker `public/sw.js`

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start dev server
- `npm run build` - production build
- `npm run build:dev` - development-mode build
- `npm run preview` - local preview
- `npm run lint` - lint code

## Dependencies

Unused chart/toast wrappers and their packages have been removed.

## Roadmap

- Optional serverless proxy for API keys (move keys server-side)
- Embeddings and RAG for retrieval-augmented content
- Auth + DB + server SRS logic
- i18n infrastructure
- Detailed analytics dashboards
- SSR/SSG for SEO
